        <h2>Hey! I'm Polly.</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>I am an UX/UI and visual designer. I like to think of myself as a multifaceted problem-solver. 
        I have had a non-traditional career path working at newspapers, advertising agencies, in-house outdoor companies 
        as well as opening my own business. All of these experiences have led me to where I am now, continuing my education 
        in UX/UI through the University of Utah and working full-time at an amazing specialized design firm in Park City, Utah.</p> 
  
        <p>Life has a way of sending you down many different paths–some hard, some easy–but ultimately shaping us to who we 
          are today. I embrace the journey, and learn from all my experiences to become better as a person as well as a 
          professional designer.</p>
        
        <p>I love to balance my time at the computer with being outdoors. I am a sports junkie, if not at my desk you 
          can find me skiing, fishing, running, hiking, biking or playing with all my animals.</p></div>
